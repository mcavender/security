This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

npx create-react-app AdminApp



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  In our
case, this is automatically done by the pom.xml project file.

In the end this code is compiled, minified, and copied into the uber security.jar file.
